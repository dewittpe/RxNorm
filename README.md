# RxNorm
An R package to interact with the RxNorm RESTfull API from the National LIbrary of
Midicine.


> RxNorm provides normalized names for clinical drugs and links its names to
> many of the drug vocabularies commonly used in pharmacy management and drug
> interaction software, including those of First Databank, Micromedex, Multum,
> and Gold Standard Drug Database. By providing links between these
> vocabularies, RxNorm can mediate messages between systems not using the same
> software and vocabulary.
>
> RxNorm now includes the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Compendial
> Nomenclature from the United States Pharmacopeial Convention. USP is a
> cumulative data set of all Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API).
